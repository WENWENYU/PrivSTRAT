Reading map (extended format) from [ pop1.bim ] 
10000 markers to be included from [ pop1.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ pop1.fam ] 
5000 individuals read from [ pop1.fam ] 
5000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
2500 cases, 2500 controls and 0 missing
0 males, 5000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ pop1.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Using merge mode 1 : consensus call (default)

10000 markers to be merged from [ pop2.bim ]
Of these, 0 are new, 10000 already exist in current data
5000 individuals merged from [ pop2.fam ] 
Of these, 5000 were new, 0 were already in current data

Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
10000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
5000 cases and 5000 controls
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10000 SNPs
10000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10000 SNPs
After filtering, 5000 cases, 5000 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 10000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
